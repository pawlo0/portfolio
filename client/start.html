          <p>ORI means folding, KAMI means paper and together form the word 'Origami'. The goal of this art is to transform a flat sheet in a recognizable form using folding and sculpting techniques.</p>
          <p>In the most simple and traditional way, Origami does not require the use of complicated tools or materials. It's as simple as picking up a piece of paper and fold it. It is precisely this simplicity that attracs me to this form or art.</p>
          <p>Having faithfully following the traditional rules of Origami on all my models, for me, the use of cuts or glue are not part of origami.</p>

          <h1 id="start">How to Start</h1>
          <p>A complex origami piece always generates some admiration. <em>- How was he able to do that starting from a just simple square? - </em>It is the most common question. But then, when the novice picks up a piece of paper and begins to fold, the admiration starts to evaporates.</p>
          <p>Origami requires patience. You can not aspire to fold complex models without learning first how to do the simplest ones. You must master the simple techniques and basic folds. Similarly, you need patience in every single model that you fold. We look for complex models and we find them beautiful but we forget that some take many hours (or days ...) to fold.</p>
          <img src="ecosae.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Ecosahedron"/>
          <p>you can fold a paper airplane is in two minutes. However, folding an elephant may take one to three hours, depending on the complexity of the model.</p>
          <p>So my advice, start with pacience.</p>
          <hr/>
          <h1 id="square">The Squre</h1>
          <p>The the tradicional Origame, the square is the origin of all forms: geometric structures, animals, objects and even people appear from just a square.</p>
          <p>And after unfolded, the forms dissolve again in the square that gave rise to them.</p>
          <img src="img_31.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="The Square"/>
          <p>Where some see a simple, empty, dull and meaningless square, the one that will fold it sees a world of possibilities in that same squre.</p>
          <hr/>
          <h1 id="symbols">The Symbols</h1>
          <p>The truth is that all origami models are made from small set of folds. So if you learn well the following symbols and folding techniques you will have no problems in bending almost any origami model.</p>
          <p>Some folds are related to each other because some are just the composition of "simpler" folds.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, even the simpliest of folds, the "valley fold" and the "mountain fold", are distinguished only by the view from were you look at it, otherwise they are exactly the same.</p>
          <hr/>
          <h2>Valley fold</h2>
          <img src="img_22a.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Valley fold"/>
          <p>Valley fold (1) means that the fold is made in your direction. In the above example, you fold the edge (A) downwards in order to find the edge (B). In a diagram, this fold is marked by a regular dashed line (dash, dash) and an arrow with full tip.</p>
          <hr/>
          <h2>Mountain fold</h2>
          <img src="img_22b.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Mountain fold"/>      
          <p>Mountain fold (1) means that the fold is made behind the paper, away from you. In the above example, you fold the edge (A) downward and behind the rest of the paper in order to find the edge (B). A mountain fold is drawn in a diagram by a dashed line punctuated by points (dash, dot, dash) and an arrow with the tip unfilled.</p>
          <hr/>
          <h2>Unfold</h2>
          <img src="img_22c.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Unfold"/>            
          <p>Unfold a fold already done is indicated by an arrow with the tip unfilled. This same arrow is used to indicate when one has to pull a paper layer.</p>
          <hr/>
          <h2>Fold and unfold</h2>
          <img src="img_22d.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Fold and unfold"/>            
          <p>Fold and unfold, aka "pre-fold" (1) is no more than the combination of the fold valley with unfold. It is marked with a fold arrow in the valley at one end (in the direction of bending) and an arrow to unfold the other end (in order to unfold).</p>
